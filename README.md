# Latex-Expanded-Thesis-Template
This is a LaTeX template based on the [University of Oslo (UiO)'s official LaTeX template (~2023)](https://www.uio.no/english/about/designmanual/profile-in-use/latex/index.html) for a master's thesis; but expanded!


## Why?
To simplify the organization and writing of your thesis from "vanskelig" to "lett", hence the name "**L**atex **E**xpanded **T**hesis **T**emplate".

### A full README is planned, featuring a tutorial of the "expanded"-part.
It will be written after the 6th of June, 2023, and published shortly after.

# How-to:
1. Download the `lett.zip`
2. Login at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)
3. Select `New Project/Upload project`
4. Upload the `lett.zip`
5. Start writing!
